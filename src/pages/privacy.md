# Polotno Privacy Policy

### As a user of the web-application where `polotno` sdk is used.

*This section is applied when you are using polotno on YOUR website.*

**TL;DR:** Polotno framework doesn't use cookies, doesn't send any personal information, doesn't track your visitors and doesn't send any information from non-polotno components of the web-page.

`polotno` SDK (javascript framework) is doing several network requests to https://api.polotno.dev/ in order to validate licence key and provide rich experience for your users.

`polotno` is using page URL for key validation request. Only `host` and `pathname` are used. `GET` parameters and hash are removed. `polotno` is using this request for very limited analytics about key usage and rate limits.

For other requests like "templates library" or "stock photos" requests, `polotno` is using only minimal arguments such as search query and key information.

Note: At any point of time you can open Developer Tools and inspect what polotno is sending.
